    <p> The Senju Clan, along with the Uchiha Clan, was one of the founding clans of Konohagakure.
        The head of the clan, Hashirama, would later become the First Hokage, and his brother would be the Second. 
        Many years later, Hashirama's granddaughter, Tsunade, would revive the tradition and become the Fifth Hokage.</p>

    <img src="https://static.zerochan.net/Uchiha.Clan.full.1926897.jpg" alt="Table of Contents" height="200" id="top">

    <p>The Uchiha Clan is known for their distinct red eyes, the Sharingan and its stronger Mangekyo form. The Sharingan enhances the visual perception of the user, as well as allow them to copy their opponent's jutsu. That gives them the upper hand in both defense and offense.
        Beyond the Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan grants the user even more power such as Amaterasu, Susanoo, and Tsukuyomi. </p>

    <p> Once a feared clan of Uzushiogakure for their immense chakra power, the Uzumaki were forced into disbandment after the destruction of their village.
